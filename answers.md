1. In Jest, what are the differences between `describe()` and `it()` globals, and what are good uses for them?

        "describe" breaks down the test into sections. "it" is used to perform specific test. 
        describe is good for grouping test for a specific endpoint, it is good for doing a specific test
        within that endpoint.


1. What is the point of `Test Driven Development`? What do you think about this approach?

    the point is to write clean code, because you are already thinking of obscure test,
    it is time consuming, but can make things a lot more scalable.

1. Mention three types of automated tests.

        unit, api, ui
